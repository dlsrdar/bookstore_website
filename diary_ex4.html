 <div class="book"><h2>   Winnie-the-Pooh  <span class="author"> by A. A. Milne </span> </h2>
	
	<p>
		In the Milne books, Pooh is naive and slow-witted, but he is also friendly, thoughtful and steadfast. Although he and his friends agree that he is "a bear of very little brain," Pooh is occasionally acknowledged to have a clever idea, usually driven by common sense.

 <div class="book"> <h2>The Handmaid's Tale  <span class="author"> by Margaret Atwood </span></h2>
	
	<p>
		After a staged attack that killed the President of the United States and most of Congress, a radical political group called the "Sons of Jacob" used quasi-Christian ideology to launch a revolution. The United States Constitution was suspended, newspapers were censored, and what was formerly the United States of America was changed into a military dictatorship known as the Republic of Gilead.
